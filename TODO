Todo May 22nd

1. Remove this and try executing a command, and then return control to event which
   further handles control to renderer. Keeps the application neatly organized.

2. Include this code in the default section of switch statement
   Switching on command enabled. Check for any argument inside default
   Every case in switch further returns a event instance.

3. Go through bower source once again thoroughly, read how the project is
   organized, go through main files, and try follow that pattern.

4. Remove eventbus as its no longer needed
   Create a custom module to print out to the
   console

5. Write necessary tests to programatically verify that
   all everything is working as expected.

6. Make renderer a standard class and let cli make an instance of it
